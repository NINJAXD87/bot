<p align="center"> SupportBot is a free self-hosted discord that is developed/designed to help control and manage the support that takes place throughout your discord server(s). SupportBot has been going around since late-2018 and it's still being constantly, updated and supported today. Alongside the core features of SupportBot which is support related features such as tickets etc.. we also allow additional addons which are made by both 3rd-party and official developers. If something goes wrong with SupportBot you can simply come to our discord server and contact us. We will be happy to help. Also! if anyone ever tells you that "nothing is free" then tell them to think again. Sometimes you just have to look a little harder to find what you want.</p>
